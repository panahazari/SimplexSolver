# Simplex Solver

This project provides an implementation of the Simplex algorithm for solving linear programming problems. It supports both maximization and minimization problems with linear constraints. The repository includes a Python class `SimplexSolver` for the algorithm implementation and a test script that demonstrates solving specific linear programming problems and validating the results using the `linprog` method from SciPy.

## Features

- Solve linear programming problems with the Simplex method.
- Supports maximization and minimization problems.
- Includes validation using SciPy's `linprog` for comparison.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- SciPy

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To install NumPy and SciPy, run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy
